This app will help set the frequency of your Windows updates so you can update when you need to and not when you are very busy.

ONLY USE IF YOU ARE HAPPY TO EDIT THE WINDOWS REGISTRY
IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THIS APP YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK
 
With a recent Windows update that took many hours to finish I lost a lot of work time. I wrote this app, not to never update again but to update when I am not busy trying to deliver customer software. As this is editing the Windows Registry you must do so at your own risk. I cannot guarantee this will work for you. This needs to be run with Admin rights. I do not automatically give it admin rights so you will need to right click and choose admin rights. I do not guarantee this tool will work for you without causing damage. It works for me and I use it.
 
Before you use this close/save all your work as this app will make your device reboot without any warning. 
 
Before I update the registry I always backup the existing one to the cloud. The button at the top will guide you through this. At the end you may wish to close Regedit app.

You then have two sets of choices, choose one or the other but not both.
1)	Enable or Disable updates
2)	Limit the way your system deals with Auto Updates.  
 
Before you change anything make sure you are happy to work with the registry and that if you are that you have backed it up.
 
Backup Registry
This will allow you to backup the registry provided your acount has enough rights to do so. 
  
Enable or Disable updates
Here we will disable automatic updates or renable them. If they are disabled then you can still go into Windows and check for updates and download them. It is your responsibility to make sure your system has all the updates you require.
 
Limit the way your system deals with Auto Updates
You have a few choices here as shown below:
 
 * 2 — Notify for download and auto install.
 * 3 — Auto download and notify for install.
 * 4 — Auto download and schedule the install.
 * 5 — Allow local admin to choose settings.
 * 7 — Auto Download, Notify to install, Notify to Restart.
 
Option number 2 is the closest to disable Windows Update on Windows 10 permanently. 
 
Choosing Remove will do as it says on the tin it will remove the key. After the Set has happened
